# APCSFinalProject

**Group Name:** Gotta Match 'Em All

**Group Members:** Austin Ngan, Jason Zhou

**Project Description:**

We are trying to create a Pokemon Shuffle “clone”, mainly focusing on its matching elements and interactions with Pokemon types. The basis of the project should have its match elements and “damage” components, as well as a turn limit for each level. The user will be able to choose from either levels to progress through the game, or a free play mode where they simply match until they want to stop. In the levels, the player will have a set amount of moves they can do and have to reach a certain score in order to beat the level.

## Development Log:
### May 24:
Jason: Worked on board class to add variables, added a way to display the board with score and moves remaining. Also started on moving elements of the array with a swap method.  

Austin: Finished creating boss and Pokemon classes with their respective constructors and get methods, as well as added the check combos methods for the board class.  

### May 25:
Jason: Worked on scanning board for valid combos and started on the process of removing combos.

Austin: Tried to create a way to use the Pokemon class in board, rather than using int arrays.

### May 26:
Jason: Finished manipulating the board through mouse input, so being able to drag and drop tiles.

Austin: Fully implemented the use of the Pokemon class in the board class, as well as prevented full combos from spawning when the board is initially generated.
