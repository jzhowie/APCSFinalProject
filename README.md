# APCSFinalProject

**Group Name:** Gotta Match 'Em All

**Group Members:** Austin Ngan, Jason Zhou

**Project Description:** 

We are trying to create a Pokemon Shuffle “clone”, mainly focusing on its matching elements and interactions with Pokemon types. The basis of the project should have its match elements and “damage” components, as well as a turn limit for each level. The user will be able to choose from either levels to progress through the game, or a free play mode where they simply match until they want to stop. In the levels, the player will have a set amount of moves they can do and have to reach a certain score in order to beat the level.
